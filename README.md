# Bluetooth-Enabled-Security-Alert-System

This project is an AVR-based door monitoring system that uses an IR sensor and a buzzer. The system allows remote control through Bluetooth communication, enabling or disabling monitoring based on received commands.

## Features
- **IR Sensor Monitoring**: Detects the state of a door (open/closed).
- **Buzzer Alert**: Activates a buzzer when the door is open (if monitoring is enabled).
- **Bluetooth Control**: Commands to toggle monitoring on and off using a Bluetooth device.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Uses UART interrupt service routine (ISR) for efficient data handling.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ATmega328P** microcontroller (or compatible AVR microcontroller).
- **IR Sensor**: Connected to `PB2` (Pin 10 on Arduino Uno).
- **Buzzer**: Connected to `PB5` (Pin 13 on Arduino Uno).
- **Bluetooth Module**: Connected to UART pins (`RX` and `TX`) of the microcontroller.

## Circuit Diagram
1. **IR Sensor**: Connect the signal pin of the IR sensor to `PB2`.
2. **Buzzer**: Connect the positive terminal of the buzzer to `PB5` through a resistor.
3. **Bluetooth Module**:
   - `RX` of the Bluetooth module to `TX` of the microcontroller.
   - `TX` of the Bluetooth module to `RX` of the microcontroller.
4. Ensure proper grounding and power connections for all components.

## Usage
1. Power on the system.
2. Connect to the Bluetooth module from your device.
3. Send the following commands via Bluetooth:
   - `E`: Enable door monitoring.
   - `D`: Disable door monitoring.
4. When monitoring is enabled, the buzzer will activate if the door is open (IR sensor triggered).

## Code Overview
The program runs the following steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Sets up UART for Bluetooth communication.
   - Configures `PB5` as an output (for the buzzer) and `PB2` as an input (for the IR sensor).
2. **Main Loop**:
   - Checks for UART data and updates the monitoring state (`monitor_door`).
   - Monitors the IR sensor and controls the buzzer based on the monitoring state.
3. **Interrupt Service Routine**:
   - Captures UART data and processes commands asynchronously.

## Customization
- Modify `#define BUZZER` and `#define IR_SENSOR` to change the pins used for the buzzer and IR sensor.
- Update `set_bluetooth_name("RSA")` to change the Bluetooth device name.
